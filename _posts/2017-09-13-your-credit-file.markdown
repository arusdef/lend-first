Your credit score is a system generated number on a scale of 0 to 1200 which provides prospective credit providers with a fast and efficient measure of your creditworthiness. Most people refer to the ‘Credit Score’ simply as their ‘Credit Rating’.

The lower your score, the higher the chance you will be unlikely to meet your new loan repayments.

The higher your score, the less chance you will fail to meet your new loan repayments. 

Simply put: the higher your score the better. A score above 600 is desirable by most lenders or credit providers.

## What makes up the Score?

The score takes into account a number of different elements.The things that contribute to a higher score is 

## Number of Enquiries
The more active your file the lower your score will be.Regular loan applications are not a good look. 5 loan applications in a 6mth period can see your score drop by 300 points. Don’t apply for loans if you never intend on taking them up if they get approved.

## Type and amount of each enquiry
Home loans and car loans don’t impact the score as much as credit cards or unsecured personal loans do.People borrowing to buy assets are generally less likely to fail on their commitments.

## Listed Defaults
Having 1 or more defaults on your file, whether it is paid or unpaid, will have a significant impact on your score.

## Age
Older people generally have a better credit score.This is because they have had more opportunity to fail.The longer the file exists without any adverse history the chances of future failure decreases dramatically

## Free Credit Reports
Regularly checking your credit score on free websites can reduce your score.Not by much but it can reduce it.Only check your credit score/obtain a credit report when you are seriously about to apply for a loan.When you do, request your report directly from Equifax and not a free credit report website.

## Late Repayments
Paying your credit card or personal loan late by just one day can impact your score if your lender reports it.This never used to be reported and at this point only a handful of lenders use this functionality but it is slowly gaining more acceptance within the industry.

These are a few of the main influencers of your credit score. Your credit score is one of the most important aspect of any loan application so it is important you understand what is happening with your own credit score.
