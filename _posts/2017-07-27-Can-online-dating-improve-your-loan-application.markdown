First Home Buyer but still single?  Hit the online dating scene to improve your chances of getting a loan. It’s simple mathematics, 1 person applying for a loan, 1 income but 2 people applying for a loan, 2 incomes.  The higher the income the higher the chance of an approval.

A single person earning $40k a year with a good deposit might only be able to borrow $250k but a couple earning $80k a year with a smaller deposit might be able to borrow $500k.

So there you have it, it’s not this size of the deposit that counts, it’s what you do with your income that matters.

Still single, try these one liners to help improve your loan application…

Roses are Red, Violets are Blue, I’m not too adhesive but I’ll stick to you!

 Is your name Gillette? Because you’re the best a man can get! 

Is your name Ariel? Because we Mermaid for each other! 

If you were a triangle, you’d be acute one! 

Is your name WiFi? Because I’m really feeling a connection!
