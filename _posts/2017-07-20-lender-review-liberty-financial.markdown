## Lendfirst Comments
A lender with a broad range of credit policies to cover most situations, First Home Buyer Friendly and are market leading when borrowers have low deposits and non genuine savings. Traditional bank products are competitively priced and a good alternative to mainstream banks.  Liberty are best when mainstream banks say no.  Their custom product suite accepts clients with credit defaults, unusual income and many other credit impairments.  There are postcode restrictions and they place a high importance on good quality security in larger towns and cities.  They apply a common sense approach to credit and service is good whilst terms and conditions are easy to understand.  There is no branch network and Liberty is not recommended if you want a lender that does everything including credit cards, insurances, transaction accounts etc. They have access to private funders who can provide short term business funding to small business owners who need fast flexible solutions such as loans with no income declarations or verifications.

## Lendfirst Scorecard
* First home buyers ★★★★★
* Upgraders ★★★☆☆
* Investors ★★★☆☆
* Credit impaired ★★★★★
* Small business ★★★★☆
