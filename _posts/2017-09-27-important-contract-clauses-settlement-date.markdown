The Settlement Date is the day when money and property title are exchanged between buyer and seller and ownership of the property officially transfers to the buyer. That is, the actual day on which transfer of cash or assets is completed and is usually a few days after the trade was done. 

## Do I have to attend a settlement?
No, your solicitor will attend on your behalf. There is no need for you to be available on the settlement day although it is recommended you remain contactable.

## Who attends the settlement?
Your solicitor, your bank, the seller’s solicitor and the sellers bank. 

## Where does the settlement take place?
Usually the settlement takes place at the seller’s bank or the sellers solicitor office. It is up to your solicitor to make their own arrangement to attend or appoint an agent to attend on your behalf if they are unable to make it.

## How long does a settlement take to complete?
Surprisingly it takes less than 5mins. After weeks of preparation the actual settlement is a very highly organised and efficient transaction.

## Do I have to do anything for the settlement?
Your broker and solicitor will have given you any instructions weeks before settlement if any action is required. Usually the main thing buyers need to do is to make sure any settlement shortfalls or outstanding deposits are made available to your solicitor on or before the morning of the settlement day.

## What if there are any Settlement conditions?
Any special conditions for settlement will be mentioned in the contract of sale. It may be written the seller is to, as an example, ‘repair the fence’ as a settlement condition. The buyer has the right to conduct a pre-settlement inspection to ensure he/she is happy the fence has been repaired. Check with your solicitor if you have any questions about what to include as a special condition on the contract.

## Can I change a settlement day?
Yes, but only if agreed to by both the seller and the buyer.

## What happens if I miss settlement?
Whether you are the buyer or the seller, if you miss the agreed settlement date for any reason you may be in breach of the contract. This could mean the contract could potentially be terminated by the other party or penalties charged. Either way, missing a settlement is a serious situation and both buyers and sellers should do everything they can to meet the agreed deadline.

## How does settlement day impact my loan?
Settlement day is the day your loan becomes effective. Interest is charged on the loan from this day and your obligations under your mortgage to the bank are in force the moment settlement is completed.
