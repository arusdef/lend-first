## Lendfirst Comments
A new lender with a fresh approach to home loans, First Home Buyer Friendly. Credit policy is slightly restrictive i.e. will not accept any self-employed applicants and they do restrict the postcodes they lend in however the credit managers are experienced and genuinely do engage with the broker to find ways to get the loan approved. Velocity reward points program is market leading and credit card options are good. Offset is available but not designed to be client’s main transactional bank. Home loan rates and pricing are extremely competitive which can sometimes lead to delays. Virgin Money are not an option for self-employed or credit impaired clients or those wanting to construct.

## Lendfirst Scorecard
* First home buyers ★★★★★
* Upgraders ★★★★☆
* Investors ★★★★☆
* Credit Impaired		
* Small Business
