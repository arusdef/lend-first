A comparison rate is a tool to help consumers identify the true cost of a loan by reducing the costs of a loan—including interest & fees—into a single percentage rate to easily compare the true cost of home loans.  We can use comparison rates to compare various loans from different lenders. 

## Why do we have them?
To reveal any hidden costs or charges associated with a home loan. 

## How are they calculated?
Application Fees and ongoing fees are reduced to a single percentage rate and added to the actual rate for comparison. If a loan has no fees the comparison rate should be the same as the actual rate. Here's an example:

|                  | Lender A      | Lender B |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Amount           | $350,000      | $350,000 |
| Term             | 30yrs         | 30yrs    |
| Actual Rate      | 4.24%         | 4.39%    |
| Application Fees | $600          | $600     |
| Fees             | $395 per year | $0       |
| Comparison Rate  | 4.42%         | 4.41%    |


## So Lender B is the better option then?
Not necessarily.  Advertised comparison rates don’t include fee waivers, discounts or other benefits. In the example, Lender A regularly waives the application fee on request but Lender B does not.  This would make Lender A’s comparison rate 4.40%.

## Why else should I be cautious about comparison rates?
The calculation does not take into account financial benefits gained from other features associated with the home loan such as:
- Interest savings from a 100% offset account or loan trimmer account
- Associated fee waivers on credit cards or bank accounts
- Associated discounts on insurances and other services

## So what is a comparison rate good for then?
They are very good when comparing introductory/fixed rate loans as the comparison is based on the full loan term not just the intro period.  Here’s an example:

|                  | Lender A | Lender B |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Amount           | $350,000 | $350,000 |
| Term             | 30yrs    | 30yrs    |
| 3yr Intro Rate   | 3.99%    | 3.99%    |
| After 3yr Rate   | 5.24%    | 4.24%    |
| Application Fees | $600     | $600     |
| Fees             | $10 mth  | $10 mth  |
| Comparison Rate  | 4.97%    | 4.22%    |


The large difference in comparison rates quickly raises an alarm. It has revealed Lender A’s catch to their special offer.  That is a much higher rate after the intro term.  The comparison rate very quickly identified this issue without the borrower having to do too much analysis.

## Should I rely on comparison rates to decide what loan is best? 
No.  They are a guide only.  Speak to a professional mortgage broker who will undertake a detailed comparison of all features, benefits & costs to ensure you have accurate information to be able to make good financial decisions.
