A 100% Offset Account is a normal everyday transaction account that is linked to your home loan which can reduce the interest charged.

The run down on offset accounts:
* They are transactional and can be used for salary credits, ATM & EFTPOS withdrawals
Accessible with internet and phone banking just like any other savings or transaction account
* They do not earn any interest
* They have no minimum balance requirements
* Must be an account held at the same bank as your home loan
* Must be in exactly the same name as the home loan â€“ If joint loan then must be joint savings account
* Usually only available with variable rate loans but a small number of banks allow them on fixed rates

To understand how 100% Offset Accounts work, you first need to understand How Do Banks Calculate Interest. 

Using the same example of $350,000 loan at 4.50% rate this time with $20,000 in a 100% offset account.
