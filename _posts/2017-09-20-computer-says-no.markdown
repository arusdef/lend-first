John had been with his bank since he was a child, he opened his savings account when he was in school, he borrowed for cars and repaid the loans early, his credit card was perfect and he had plenty of savings. His parents banked there all their lives and John had referred many friends to the bank, he was a very loyal customer.

When John found the home he’d always wanted, he applied for a loan with his bank but it was declined. John had the savings, he proved he had the income, he had an excellent credit score and never missed a repayment in his life so what went wrong.

John was a casual, had been for years, but 11 months ago he changed to a new employer doing the same job but for better pay. Sounds fine right? Wrong! Bank policy said John needed to be with his current employer for 12 months. 

Now the average person would say fine he will be 12 months when the loan starts so no problem. Wrong again! The policy says 12 months at time of application.

Now more than ever, common sense is thrown out the window in favour of what’s written on a checklist. The comedy show ‘Little Britain’ took fun of the issue in their ‘Computer Says No’ sketch and whilst many may laugh, it is now closer to reality than what many people realise.

If you're applying for a loan, forget loyalty, forget brand names, forget special offers and focus on what the computer is going to say.
