Belinda & John wanted to buy their first home. Belinda worked FT with a good wage and John was a stay at home dad. They had no debts and a little savings. They paid $420 per week rent and thought it was time to start paying off their own home. The problem was, Belinda & John used their rent payment as a benchmark for working out what they could buy. 

Using a generic loan calculator, they worked out they could borrow $385k so they searched for weeks and weeks for the perfect home within their price range and they finally found the perfect one.

Unfortunately, when they applied for a loan, they were shocked to find out they could only borrow $280,000 but why? There were 3 things Belinda and John forgot to consider:

* __Rates.__ As a tenant, you don’t have to pay council rates but you do as the owner. This can add about $50 per week in expenses.
* __Insurance.__ As a tenant, you don’t have to insure the building but you do as the home owner. This adds another $30 per week in expenses.
* __Interest.__ As a tenant, your rent does not always change when interest rates do but it does when you are the owner. A rate increase of 2% adds an extra $80 per week to your loan repayments ($280,000 loan).

A simple test to work out your borrowing capacity using your rent as a benchmark is to ask yourself this question. “If my rent increased by $150 per week, could I still afford to live where I am now?”

If your answer was yes but you might have to stop eating out as much then your expectations are close to reality but if the answer was no way I’d have to move into a cheaper rental, then you should consider setting your expectations a little lower on what you can afford.
