There’s yeast, cinnamon, oil, cream, jam, chocolate and the many other ingredients. If the cost of some or all of these ingredients increase, than it is logic and reality that the overall price we pay for the donut increases too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s assume the price of jam, cream &amp;amp; yeast are all controlled by the one supplier, let’s say this supplier is a government organisation charged with ensuring the health and well-being of all Australians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are eating too many donuts and risk becoming overweight &amp;amp; unhealthy, this organisation will increase the cost of jam, cream &amp;amp; yeast which will increase the price of donuts and we stop buying donuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If on the other hand we are not buying enough donuts, the donut making industry would cease to exist and thousands would be out of work so the supplier lowers the cost of jam, cream &amp;amp; yeast resulting in cheaper donuts and we buy more donuts allowing everyone to keep their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now assume the donut maker is a Bank, the government organisation is the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the cash rate is jam, cream &amp;amp; yeast.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">So the cost of donuts has gone up $0.50 but before you write to your local member of parliament demanding a royal commission let’s have a think about the costs that go into making a donut.

A full offset means that 100% of the funds in your offset account will be deducted from what you owe on your home loan before interest is calculated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The run down on offset accounts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are transactional and can be used for salary credits, ATM &amp;amp; EFTPOS withdrawals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessible with internet and phone banking just like any other savings or transaction account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They do not earn any interest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They have no minimum balance requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must be an account held at the same bank as your home loan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must be in exactly the same name as the home loan – If joint loan then must be joint savings account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Usually only available with variable rate loans but a small number of banks allow them on fixed rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how 100% offset accounts work, you first need to understand &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-do-banks-calculate-interest/&quot;&gt;how banks calculate interest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the same example of $350,000 loan at 4.50% rate this time with $20,000 in a 100% offset account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(Loan Balance – Offset Balance) X (Annual Rate/365) = Daily Interest
($350,000 - $20,000) X (4.50% / 365) = Daily Interest
$330,000 X 0.0123287% = Daily Interest 
$40.68 = Daily Interest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is done every day.  At the end of a 30 day month, the total daily amounts $1,221 is debited to the loan so the loan balance becomes $351,221.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normal monthly payment of $1,774 is still made and loan balance then starts day 1 of the next month at $349,447.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$349,447 - $20,000 X 0.0123287% = $40.62
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may not seem like much but you have saved $2.47 a day.  Over 12 months that’s a saving of approximately $900.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful, some offsets come with extra fees and higher rates. Here is a real example of the difference in one lenders products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;$350,000 Loan with $20,000 in Offset&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Basic no offset&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;With Offset&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Interest Rate&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4.10%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4.65%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Monthly Fees&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$33&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Daily Interest&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$39.31&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$44.59&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Monthly Cost&lt;br /&gt;(interest + fees)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1,179.30&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1,370.70&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Monthly Offset Benefit&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$76.44&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Net monthly cost&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1,179.30&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1,294.26&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*$50,000 is the min balance needed to be better off with offset in this example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example does not apply in all situations but it does highlight the potential downsides to 100% offset accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">A 100% Offset Account is a normal everyday transaction account that is linked to your home loan which can reduce the interest charged.

Spotting a facebook ad for a fishing shop ‘Closing Down – 50% off everything’ sale got my interest with no ‘Upto’ clause inserted. I checked the bank balance, worked out how to explain it to my wife and jumped online credit card in hand and they didn’t disappoint, there were bargains galore and thanked the fishing gods for my good fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding the bargains to my cart I went to checkout but there was no section for postage. Confused I read the fine print to discover the discount only applied to store pick up.  No good when you live 2,500klms away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen banks, brokers and online lenders advertise home loans in a similar way.  Cheap rates are advertised and all are genuine, but reading the fine print they are only available to certain borrowers.  Some only apply to those with 30% deposits, some to capital cities and almost none for small deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing 35+ lenders, there are over 5,000 different interest rate variations all with different requirements.  Do not make decisions based on an advertised interest rate.  There is no point making key life decisions on a cheap rate you saw on facebook if you do not qualify for it.
The fine print is the key determining factor of your interest rate and the fine print is now changing faster than it ever has before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t ignore rates completely, just don’t make big life decisions based on them alone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">Being a keen angler, I’m always on the lookout for new fishing gear.

The daily rate is then applied to the loan balance each day. Assume a $350,000 loan with an interest rate of 4.50%. Figures are rounded for ease of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Loan Balance X (Annual Rate/365) = Daily Interest
$350,000 X (4.50% / 365) = Daily Interest
$350,000 X 0.0123287% = Daily Interest
$43.15 = Daily Interest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This calculation is done every day. At the end of a 30 day month, the total $1,294 is debited to the loan so the balance becomes $351,294.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually on this day the monthly payment of $1,774 is made and the loan balance starts day 1 of the next month at $349,520 and the process starts again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$349,521 X 0.0123287% = $43.09
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same calculation applies regardless of whether the loan is a fixed or variable rate. If the loan settles on say 13th of the month, it is the number of days until the 13th of the next month and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding this process is critical in deciding which loan features (redraws, offsets) and repayment options (weekly, fortnightly, monthly) work best.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">Home loan rates are shown as an annual rate but are divided by 365 to get a daily rate (use 366 for a leap year).

Ignoring stereotypes, Bob was actually a very down to earth, genuine nice guy but terrible with money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, he was advised to change his home loan to a revolving line of credit and open a credit card.  He was to put his salary into the line of credit and spend on the credit card.  At the end of the month he would transfer the credit card balance in full from the line of credit thus avoiding interest on the credit card and saving $100’s in interest on the home loan during the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds great in theory however the one big flaw was the credit card limit the adviser gave Bob.  The limit on Bob’s credit card equalled his net monthly income so Bob being the spendthrift he was, blew his credit card limit every month and surprise surprise Bob’s home loan balance never reduced a cent in over 5yrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve Bob’s problem, we first changed his home loan to a term loan with principal and interest repayments.  Not only did this give Bob a firm structure and plan to reduce his loan balance he also saved a bit of interest in the process as revolving line of credit facilities are more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we found a loan that had a full 100% offset included.  When used properly, this feature has the same benefit as a line of credit but forces the loan to reduce to zero after 30yrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we reviewed Bob’s household budget and reduced his credit card limit to equal his monthly expenses not his monthly income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilising the same strategy as the previous adviser but with a different product and credit card limit in place Bob can now actually start paying his loan off sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to report that Bob has paid his loan off in under 5yrs but that would be a lie.  Bob couldn’t help himself and continues to spend like crazy but at least now his loan is reducing every month and each month he is building more and more equity in his home in the hope that one day, he will spend his money on something more useful, like an investment property perhaps!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><category term="problem solved" /><category term="debt" /><summary type="html">A client of mine, who we shall call Bob, earned an obscenely high amount of income, he drove a brand new BMW, always wore nice Italian suits and travelled overseas at least twice a year.

&lt;p&gt;The top 5 reasons why a pre-approval is bad for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-they-expire-after-90days&quot;&gt;1. They expire after 90days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 90days you start from scratch again. A new application form and fresh information on everything you already provided is needed.  Even after 30 days, most lenders still require fresh payslips, bank statements etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-it-is-not-a-full-assessment&quot;&gt;2. It is not a full assessment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-approvals have so many conditions in the fine print, they are practically a worthless piece of paper.  With most lenders, payslips are not checked, bank statements are not verified and mortgage insurers are never asked for approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-no-protection-against-policy-changes&quot;&gt;3. No protection against policy changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a lender changes policies during the 90days, the new policy will be enforced.  This happened in 2015 when thousands of investors were caught out by banks increasing minimum deposits for investors.  Many lost $1,000’s in deposits and fees because they relied upon a pre-approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-can-ruin-credit-historys&quot;&gt;4. Can ruin credit history’s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time a lender does a pre-approval, an enquiry is made on your credit file. If you have multiple pre-approvals even with the same lender this will negatively impact on your credit.  This could result in a formal application being declined because the credit file is too ‘busy’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-its-a-sneaky-sales-trick&quot;&gt;5. It’s a sneaky sales trick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry encourages pre-approvals because it stops buyers shopping around. Buyers can get locked into a bad deal because they can’t go to another lender as their credit file is now too busy and can only go with the lender who issued the original pre-approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some circumstances, a pre-approval can be extremely beneficial and is the best course of action for some applicants however for the most part, speaking with a highly trained and experienced mortgage broker can often give the buyer just as much confidence to make an offer without impacting on credit files or missing out on a really good deal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><category term="borrowing" /><summary type="html">A pre-approval of finance before shopping for a house is common for many buyers and recommended by many lending experts but applying for a pre-approval could ruin your chances when it comes to making a formal application.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://lendfirst.com.au/uploads/post-5-reasons-why-pre-approvals-are-bad.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Fixed or Variable—which is best for me?</title><link href="https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/fixed-or-variable-which-is-best-for-me/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fixed or Variable—which is best for me?" /><published>2016-08-22T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2016-08-22T00:00:00+10:00</updated><id>https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/fixed-or-variable-which-is-best-for-me</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/fixed-or-variable-which-is-best-for-me/">&lt;p&gt;In the great debate between fixed and variable rate loans there are those that are firmly planted in the always go variable and those that believe fixed rates are the only option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most borrowers have no idea which one to go with. Proponents of variable rates value flexibility and extra payments but those with fixed rate loans want their rate protected against rises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no right or wrong answer and the correct answer always depends on your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you intend on selling your home soon, refinancing the loan, making extra repayments, subdividing or simply changing the name to a married/maiden name then you should consider going variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have no plans for any of the above and just want to ensure your repayments don’t change suddenly on you, then you should consider a fixed rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some fixed rate loans allow extra repayments and some even have an offset facility, so making extra/lump sum payments is still a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, 80% of borrowers who choose a fixed rate loan are worse off at the end of their term had they of chosen variable.  Remember, the banks are very good at predicting interest rates and even better at making this work in their favour not yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next time you choose between fixed or variable, make sure you choose for the right reasons, not because one is cheaper than the other.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><category term="interest rates" /><summary type="html">In the great debate between fixed and variable rate loans there are those that are firmly planted in the always go variable and those that believe fixed rates are the only option.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://lendfirst.com.au/uploads/post-fixed-or-variable-which-is-best-for-me.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Are you a DIY borrower?</title><link href="https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/are-you-a-diy-borrower/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Are you a DIY borrower?" /><published>2016-08-15T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2016-08-15T00:00:00+10:00</updated><id>https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/are-you-a-diy-borrower</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/are-you-a-diy-borrower/">&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows one, the obsessive ‘DIY’er.

&lt;p&gt;Now don’t get me wrong there are some genius handymen out there that can fix anything, but the sad reality is, most of us don’t and usually make things worse and more expensive by trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a home loan is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going directly to a bank for a home loan, makes you a DIY borrower.  You only get information that is relevant for that bank, not what is relevant for you.
A client of mine wanted to upgrade to a bigger home but didn’t want to sell the old one first. They spoke to many banks directly and were told by all of them it was not possible and they had to sell first, rent then buy the new house, if it was still for sale.  This was avoided with a specialised bridging product from a smaller bank that allowed the client to buy first, move in and then sell the old saving the client considerable cost and inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this client decided to DIY the solution, they would still be in a rental waiting for their dream home to come on the market again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain surgery should not be a DIY activity and nor should getting a home loan. Do it right, get help from the right people and your ego will thank you for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><category term="borrowing" /><summary type="html">Everyone knows one, the obsessive ‘DIY’er.

Most believe the Reserve Bank has ultimate control over interest rates. Every month, mortgage holders anxiously await the outcome of the RBA’s monthly board meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experience is like servicing the family car and waiting for the bill.  The job is done and you know you have to pay for it no matter what but as the mechanic starts explaining he adjusted the ‘Pressure Feedback EGA Sensor’ and tightened the support bolts on the ‘A/C Clutch Field Coil’ you start thinking this is going to be expensive, but then he doesn’t charge you as it only took a minute to fix. You drive home feeling like you’ve just won the lotto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand who has ultimate control over your interest rates lets consider a shop owner who sells kitchen tables. If building a kitchen table requires one plank of timber at a cost of $200 the shop owner does not sell it for $200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same principle applies to money. If a bank buys money for 2%, it will not sell it for 2%.  Just like the shop owner, the bank must cover its costs and provide profit to its owners, otherwise it is just a charity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shop owner can sell the kitchen table for whatever price he or she wants regardless of the raw cost of timber. If timber prices stay the same but cost of screws increase, the shop owner will increase the price of the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise if a rival furniture retailer sells the same table cheaper, the original shop owner reduces the price to compete. If the shop owner doesn’t manage this process well, they could soon be out of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our banks operate exactly the same way and behave in the same manner as the shop owner, so next time your home loan rate changes ‘Out of Step’ with the reserve bank, just look at your kitchen table and think to yourself, maybe the price of screws have gone up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><category term="interest rates" /><category term="reserve bank" /><category term="mortgage" /><summary type="html">Does the Reserve Bank really have control over home loan interest rates?
