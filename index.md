  quote: "“When doctors look at X-rays, they see more because they know anatomy and
    what to look for in the mix of light and shadow. Over the years they have learned
    to more clearly discern slight differences in shape and shade that to us are indiscernible.”\n"
  text: 'Through constant exposure to a variety of financial advice problems over
    many years, Michael uses his intuition to see answers to financial problems when
    others cannot even see the problem. If you seem to be stuck, or you’re looking
    at accepting terms that aren’t as good as you’d hoped, perhaps Michael can give
    you a new way of looking at the situation.
