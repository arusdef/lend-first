Most brokers rely on complex and confusing software programs to help provide the best lending solution for the client. However, software programs are only as good as the information the lender puts into them and more often than not this information is incorrect.  

Michael does not use software programs to work out solutions but rather he will spend hours researching lender policy manuals, websites and lender contacts to ensure the advice he gives is faultless, 100% accurate and up to date.

Most brokers also have 3 or 4 favourite lenders and try to make the clients circumstances fit with one of those lenders because they don’t have the industry knowledge to discuss options outside of their favourites.  Michael only ever matches the lender to your situation, not the other way around like most do.

Michael has extensive lending knowledge and has the ability to explain the mortgage landscape and how this impacts your particular situation in a manner that is easy to follow and understand. 

He specialises in complex residential and commercial lending scenarios that other brokers and banks find too difficult. Other brokers and bank managers often refer clients to Michael due to his industry knowledge and experience knowing that he will be able to find a solution where they simply can’t.

Michael will liaise with all parties involved in your property transaction to ensure any problems are dealt with quickly and with as little fuss as possible.  This means that when you engage Michael to help you with your property transaction, you can rest easy knowing an expert has you covered.

<h4 id="what-is-a-mortgage-broker">What is a Mortgage Broker?</h4>
An independent finance specialist who analyses your needs and matches those needs with the most suitable lending product from a range of lenders not just the one bank. A mortgage broker will assist you with your paperwork such as loan applications and supporting documents.  The best mortgage brokers are one’s who educate you and advise you on your finance options and don’t just simply take your order.

During the property finance transaction, a mortgage broker and a solicitor are the only two experts that are genuinely working in your best interests.  The bank certainly isn’t and the solicitor is not equipped to manage your finance options.  It’s even worse if you are refinancing, because without a mortgage broker on your team, no-one is working in your best interests at all.

<h4 id="what-qualifications-does-a-mortgage-broker-have">What Qualifications does a Mortgage Broker need to have?</h4>
Mortgage brokers must have completed a minimum Certificate IV in Finance and Mortgage Broking, be a member of an external dispute resolution scheme, be a member of an industry body such as MFAA or FBAA and be officially licensed by ASIC.

There are no requirements for a Mortgage Broker to have any prior lending experience other than have a mentor look over their first couple of loan applications.

If you want the best people working for you, ask your broker what industry experience they have and remember, just because some-one’s been a broker for 10 years does not automatically mean they are good at what they do or have the right experience to help you effectively.

<h4 id="how-does-a-mortgage-broker-get-paid">How does a Mortgage Broker get paid?</h4>
Brokers generally receive commissions from the lender which have no impact on your bank fees or interest rate.  Often, the lender is selected by you after full disclosure of all commissions the broker is to receive.  Most brokers offer their services for free but from time to time with certain types of loans the lenders will not pay the broker any commissions.  In these situations, the broker may charge you a fee for arranging the finance or from time to time, brokers may charge you fees as they may offer extra value that justifies it.  If a broker does charge you a fee, this could just mean they have more to offer you but they cannot charge it unless you agree.
